Ticket Website Capstone Project
The problem that we are faced with is the vast number of ticket websites which often make it difficult to find the best deals on purchasing tickets for a game. Our solution is to make a website which allows you to find the best deals for a game based on the prices of all contending websites. Being able to have one primary location with all ticket prices makes it easy to find the best deal and gets rid of a lot of the hassle.
Some immediate to-dos that we have are to learn how we can access data from the websites and start basic implementation of that. Something else we need to do is learn more about web design and creating a website.
